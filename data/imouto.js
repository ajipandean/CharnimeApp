    name: 'Izumi Sagiri',
    from: 'Eromanga-sensei',
    code: 'sagiri',
    appearance: 'Sagiri is tremendously cute, a young little girl with porcelain skin, long silver hair tied with two small pink ribbons at the sides of her head, two small pink ribbons at the end of her hair, and a big pink ribbon at the end of the hair at the back. She has big blue eyes. She wears pink pajamas, and sometimes has a dark green hoodie on over them. She also wears pink slippers with bows on them. She usually has a calmed expression on her face, but sometimes she is seen embarrassed or smiling.',
    personality: 'Sagiri is depicted as a hikikomori who does not get along with others. She loves drawing and appears to be shy and easily embarrassed. Initially, she cared little for her brother but eventually opens up to him. She is normally very quiet and tends to use a speaker to be heard, but whenever she\'s on webcam drawing live, she is more lively (though still careful to hide her face). Sagiri is also a neat person who keeps her things clean. She is easily prone to anger and jealousy and is more worried and possessive about her brother, more than she would admit, to the point that she sometimes throws tantrums. She hopes to watch an anime created by her and Masamune together. Due to her shyness, she refuses to call her self \'Eromanga\' because of how perverted the name sounds and denies having such a perverted name; despite that, she admits that she enjoys drawing erotic images. Sagiri is also stubborn when Masamune forgot to bring her food for a few days, she refused to leave her room to get food because she felt like she\'d have lost. Due to fear and embarrassment, on her live video feeds, Sagiri disguised her voice as male.'

    name: 'Kousaka Kirino',
    from: 'Ore no imouto ga konna ni kawaii wake ga nai',
    code: 'kirino',
    appearance: 'Kirino has long hair dyed light brown and blue eyes. She has a small tiger-like tooth that can be often seen when she opens her mouth. Her back-length hair forms two fringes that curl towards her face and has two fringes that point outwards, with two long locks hanging loose on each side of her face. She prefers to let her hair untied, but uses two hair clips to secure the fringes of hair on her forehead. The rest reaches her waist. Her original hair color before she dyed it was dark brown, a shade similar to Manami\'s. She is more or less tall and has a well-proportioned body and long legs.',
    personality: 'Kirino is known for having a go-getter attitude. She shows a keen focus to anything she deems interesting, whether it is studying and athletics, or hobby-related activities. This attitude of hers when it comes to school activities has rewarded her with above-average marks, even as she enters the career of modeling. She developed a sort of perfectionist attitude due to becoming an overachiever, which eventually made her more prone to struggling when the odds are against her. When these moments come; however, she displays a more passive side. During her initial interactions with Kyousuke, she demonstrates an attitude similar to a "Tsundere", with the bossy and abusive part more dominant. Although she maintains this attitude, she slowly tries to open up to her brother at times, reluctantly expressing gratitude on things that Kyousuke has done for her. It is later clarified that she does care for Kyousuke, although she chooses indirect methods, sometimes laced with her sharp tongue, to show her sisterly affection for him. She has a strong "little sister" fetish and owns many adult games with older brother/little sister themes, which is funded by her salary for modeling. Despite this, she insists that she does not know why she started liking it, though it is suggested that Kirino has a brother complex and is using the games as a surrogate to this. She often denies such feelings and believes the 2D and 3D worlds should be kept separate. Aside from this, she is also an avid fan of Stardust☆Witch Meruru and any series with cute themes in general.'

    name: 'Isshiki Iroha',
    from: 'Yahari ore no seshun rabu kome wa machigatte iru',
    code: 'iroha',
    appearance: 'Iroha is a cute teenage girl with shoulder-length bobbed brown hair. She usually wears the Sobu High uniform with a light pink cardigan. She doesn\'t wear the uniform up to school standards. Her hair color is said to be natural.',
    personality: 'Iroha acts like an air-head or "clumsy girl" in front of most people to maintain her “cute appearance”. She maintains her image of an innocent girl in order to make everyone like her and make it easier to manipulate others. In reality, she is much smarter than she lets on, and rarely shows her sly and calculating personality to others. Hachiman Hikigaya and Hayato Hayama see through her facade while others remain clueless. As pointed out by Hayato, she worries about her public image. She didn\'t want to lose the student council election in a way that would make her look bad. Although she has no issue with being seen around Hachiman who is "hated" in the school. According to Hachiman\'s observations, Iroha is an uncute Komachi Hikigaya, better Minami Sagami, phony Meguri Shiromeguri, different Kaori Orimoto and inferior Haruno Yukinoshita. He later deems her the "the second most rotten person in the world", the first obviously being himself. Hachiman feels that she is the type to be hated by other girls for her cuteness and her closeness to Hayama. She lacks self-confidence but this starts to change when she overhears Hachiman\'s request for "something genuine". And after the Christmas play is completed successfully.'
